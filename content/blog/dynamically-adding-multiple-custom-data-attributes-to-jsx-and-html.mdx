## Adding attributes to JSX

This is simple and you will find hundred blog posts about it.

```tsx
<article
	data-has-keywords
>
```

This will create a HTML element:

```html
<article
	data-has-keywords="true"
>
```

To make it dynamic you could use derived values or state in React (or other frontened framework).


```tsx
<article
	data-has-keywords={data.length}
>
```
In case data array is empty:

```html
// data = [];
<article
	data-has-keywords="false"
>
```

If it has any elements inside:

```html
// data = ["one","two"];
// dataKeywords = {data-keyword-one:"one",data-keyword-two:"two"};
<article
	data-has-keywords={Object.keys(dataKeywords).length}
>
```

## Multiple Dynamic Keys with Tagged Template Literals

Now the real issue is what to do when you want to create custom keys with dynamic values and using tagged template literals for it.

In my case I wanted to have `data-keyword-` for every skill in the CV so it could be highlighted with CSS without relying on JavaScript.

As you can tell by using the page every skill has multiple keywords assigned to it ex.: "Javascript, Typescript, CSS" etc. and these keywords have the language name assigned after the keyword and it's display value.

```html
  <article data-keyword-javascript:"Javascript" data-keyword-typescript:"Typescript" data-keyword-frontend:"Frontend"
  ...
  >
```

## Coded solution

```ts
  let dataKeywords = {};
	keywords?.forEach((keyword) => {
		const attr = { [`data-keyword-${keyword.toLowerCase()}`]: keyword };
		dataKeywords = {
			...dataKeywords,
			...attr,
		};
  });
```

And in JSX:

```tsx
<article
	key={`skill-${name}-${skillIndex}`}
	{...dataKeywords}
>
```

The tricky part is to use `[]` array brackets when creating an object key with [tagged template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals). If not used it will complain with error:

```error
Property assignment expected.
```
