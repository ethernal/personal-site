title: CSS :has pseudo-class introduction
author: Sebastian Pieczynski
abstract: The CSS :has() operator is a functional pseudo-class that selects an element if any of the relative selectors passed as an argument match at least one element when anchored against this element 1. It presents a way of selecting a parent element or a previous sibling element with respect to a reference element by taking a relative selector list as an argument 1. The :has() pseudo-class takes on the specificity of the most specific selector in its arguments the same way as :is() and :not() do 1.

The CSS :has() operator is a functional pseudo-class that selects an element if any of the relative selectors passed as an argument match at least one element when anchored against this element 1. It presents a way of selecting a parent element or a previous sibling element with respect to a reference element by taking a relative selector list as an argument 1. The :has() pseudo-class takes on the specificity of the most specific selector in its arguments the same way as :is() and :not() do 1.

Here is an example of how to use the :has() operator in CSS:

<Image
	src="/laptop-open-with-code-editor.jpg"
	width={540}
	height={320}
	alt="open laptop with code"
/>

```css
/* Selects an h1 heading with a paragraph element that immediately follows the h1 and applies the style to h1 */
h1:has(+ p) {
  margin-bottom: 0;
}
```

If the :has() pseudo-class itself is not supported in a browser, the entire selector block will fail unless :has() is in a forgiving selector list, such as in :is() and :where(). The :has() pseudo-class cannot be nested within another :has(). This is because many pseudo-elements exist conditionally based on the styling of their ancestors and allowing these to be queried by :has() can introduce cyclic querying. Pseudo-elements are also not valid selectors within :has() and pseudo-elements are not valid anchors for `:has()` 1.

Here are some resources that provide more information about the CSS :has operator:

Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) provides detailed information about the syntax, examples, and browser compatibility of the CSS :has operator 1.
CSS-Tricks provides examples of how to use the CSS :has selector to select elements that contain elements that match the selector you pass into the `:has()` function 23.
I hope this helps!

## Examples

Styling a parent element based on the presence of a child element: You can use the :has() pseudo-class to style a parent element based on the presence of a child element. For example, you can select all `<div>` elements that contain an `<h1>` element and apply a background color to them:
CSS

```css
div:has(h1) {
  background-color: #f2f2f2;
}
```

Styling an element based on the presence of a sibling element: You can use the :has() pseudo-class to style an element based on the presence of a sibling element. For example, you can select all `<p>` elements that immediately follow an `<h1>` element and apply a margin-bottom property to the `<h1>` element:

```css
h1:has(+ p) {
  margin-bottom: 0;
}
```

Styling an element based on the presence of multiple child elements: You can use the :has() pseudo-class to style an element based on the presence of multiple child elements. For example, you can select all `<div>` elements that contain both an `<h1>` and a `<p>` element and apply a border to them:
CSS

```css
div:has(h1 + p) {
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
}
```

Styling an element based on the presence of a specific child element: You can use the :has() pseudo-class to style an element based on the presence of a specific child element. For example, you can select all `<ul>` elements that contain an `<li>` element with a class of “active” and apply a background color to them:
CSS

```css
ul:has(li.active) {
  background-color: #f2f2f2;
}
```
