Thank you for being here with me and if I may I wish you a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! Let it be better than this one and may it bring you peace and joy!

## Review of 2023

Hello mates and thank you for visiting. It has been an intense year to say the least. I am sure I am not alone feeling this way. 2023 had it's ups and downs but I can't help but be thankful for it..

I have made new friends, restored some old ones and delivered projects, learned new things and finally realized my long life dream of building my own small cove in the corner of the web where I can share with everyone what I have learned and what I am passionate about.

Not all is roses though. I have been going through tough experiences in my life. Luckily I do have support of my family and loved ones as well as few of my friends. You are amazing and I thank you for that!

If you are new here let's see what happened in these last few weeks since I launched the website:

All in all I published 7 articles (not counting this one) about various topics: from [creating a design system with dark mode using Tailwind](/article/dark-mode-and-design-system-with-tailwind-in-next-js), through some [key features in React](/article/why-do-i-need-key-when-mapping-through-list-of-items-in-react) to two mini series, one about [creating a web scraper](/article/project-creating-web-scrapper-with-prisma-and-typescript-part-1) and [storing the data locally](/article/project-creating-web-scrapper-with-prisma-and-typescript-part-2) and the other focused on [end to end testing with Playwright](/article/end-to-end-testing-with-playwright-introduction) and [detecting and fixing flaky tests](/article/testing-creating-confidence-in-tests).

These do take time to create and next year I'll slow down a bit to create content that will be high quality and useful. I am certain you'll enjoy it.

## Plans for 2024

I will slow down the pace of the articles so they can be even better than the mini series I've created and I hope to show you some cool new things that will be available in both CSS and React.
This will also allow me to work on the website more as there are things that need my attention apart from writing.

## Best wishes for 2024

So I hope you enjoy what I do and it inspires you in work or private projects.

Remember you are valuable as a human regardless of what you do or where you live. We all struggle in one way or another but we will endure and come out stronger. Have a great end of the year and see you in the next one!

PS. next article will be published in mid January.
