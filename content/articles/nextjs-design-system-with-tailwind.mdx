<p className="text-3xl text-theme-accent font-semibold font-heading">Hello Engineers!</p>

When designing this website the thing that has changed the most and took longest to get right was the design system and streamlining the DX (Developer eXperience) for dark mode.

I wanted a simple solution that would be intuitive and straightforward to use with TailwindCSS. I love using the right tools and as much of the native ones as possible so I wanted to leverage CSS variables but I also wanted to use TailwindCSS the right way&trade; without "smart" or hacky code.

At the time of writing I am very happy with the solution and I would like to share with you what I learned and how it's implemented on this website. The added benefit is that content flashing will not happen when using this method!

But the road to get there as I mentioned was nothing but straightforward.

## In the beginning...

There was a developer and there was a black IDE. IDE was empty and only the cursor was pulsing slowly. After a time a developer started to write code. The cursor was moving and the IDE was filled with code. The developer was happy it was good flow, pixels were drawn on the screen thanks to the words unspoken but written. Sooner rather than later something went wrong.. variables were all over the place with names set as they saw fit not as intended by their creator, paddings and margins were not uniform and changing color required editing each place separately. It was a mess and developer was sad.

The purge was needed.

...

If that short story reminds you of a thing or two then as you can clearly see you are not alone. Working with designers and having defined the details of how things are supposed to work helps a lot. If it's a solo project that has no defined structure yet then, well sometimes it starts living it's own life.

Thankfully I was already using TailwindCSS (it's awesome, really!) and there is documentation showing how to use CSS variables with Tailwind classes: see [how to use variables with Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/variables) <NewTabIcon/> and especially how to define colors to be fully usable the same way as "native" Tailwind classes: see [how to define colors](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors) <NewTabIcon/>. Using these two methods I was able to keep things configurable with variables as I wanted and also use only Tailwind to get there. Win - win!

Try it now:

1. Open the developer tools (press in most browsers F12) and in the `Inspect` tab and filter for `root` element then in the CSS section paste this code for the `element`:

For light mode:
```js
--theme-light-background-primary: 55 30% 70%;
```

For dark mode:
```js
--theme-dark-background-primary: 55 30% 70%;
```

Now the page background and few other elements are light green.

## Design system

The system is a fancy name here for a set of rules and tokens, the ones I chose work as follows:

Every variable tries to follow this patters `theme-[light/dark]-[property]-[value]-[modifier/discriminator]`.
For example: `--theme-light-background-primary` so it's theme variable for light mode that modifies the background property and it is it's primary version.

This requires us to be very specific about the use of the variable and has added benefit of being verbose. I do prefer that to some short names no one will remember in three weeks or two. It makes code more readable and most importantly anyone reading this code will figure out what it does after checking other classes following the same pattern.

### Implementation

To create design system using TailwindCSS and CSS variables we need to define the variable in the `:root` element and then we can use it in the `tailwind.config.ts`. This is the only "drawback" as the variables are defined in one file and used mostly in another but they are sometimes needed when we want to create global styles utilizing them.

Example of few CSS variables used:

```globals.css
  --theme-gap-card: 2rem;
  --theme-padding-default: 2rem;
  --theme-radius-default: 6px;

  --theme-mute-factor: 0.4;

  /* COLORS */
  /* Light */
  --theme-light-color-primary: 80deg 90% 30%;

  --theme-light-foreground-light: 50deg 10% 10%;
  --theme-light-foreground-dark: 50deg 0% 0%;

  --theme-light-background-primary: 50deg 10% 90%;
  --theme-light-background-secondary: 50deg 20% 80%;

  /* Dark */

  --theme-dark-color-primary: 220deg 90% 20%;

  --theme-dark-foreground-light: 230deg 95% 95%;
  --theme-dark-foreground-dark: 230deg 45% 5%;

  --theme-dark-background-primary: 230deg 45% 4%;
  --theme-dark-background-secondary: 225deg 35% 15%;

  --theme-dark-foreground-primary: 220deg 100% 100%;

  --theme-accent: 12 80% 43%;
```

And then we can use these variables to create classes in Tailwind.

```tailwind.config.ts
theme: {
		extend: {
      borderRadius: {
        'theme-default': 'var(--theme-radius-default)',
      },
      /* ,,, */
      colors: {
        'theme-dark-background-primary':
        'hsl(var(--theme-dark-background-primary) / <alpha-value>)',
        'theme-dark-background-primary-muted':
        'hsl(var(--theme-dark-background-primary) / var(--theme-mute-factor))',
      },
    }
}
```

You probably saw that I was not completely honest with you. I have broken the pattern for the variable names here:

```css
--theme-gap-card: 2rem;
--theme-padding-default: 2rem;
--theme-radius-default: 6px;
--theme-mute-factor: 0.4;
```

These short values are working more like globals / universal values or partials ex. `--theme-mute-factor` is used in tandem with colors to create muted color variants. If at any point I decide they are muted too little or too much I only need to change value in this one place.


Examples:

```tailwind.config.ts
'theme-dark-background-primary': 'hsl(var(--theme-dark-background-primary) / <alpha-value>)',

'theme-dark-background-primary-muted': 'hsl(var(--theme-dark-background-primary) / var(--theme-mute-factor))',
```

By defining only the values for `hsl(...)` CSS function we can now use the Tailwind's `<alpha-value>` placeholder for the alpha channel and use the same opacity syntax as for every other Tailwind defined color:

```html
<div class="bg-theme-light-background-primary/10">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

If we defined the CSS variable including `hsl` function we would have lost the ability to control the alpha channel and the code above would not work.

## Configuring Dark Mode in Tailwind

Configuring the "dark mode" in Tailwind is done with only one line of code in the `tailwind.config.ts` file. Using it with our design is also straightforward but I will show you some cool ways to make it easier to implement into the website or app.

First we need to setup how dark mode should be handled by Tailwind itself. For Next.js I have found that using the `class` method is the most optimal way as it integrates well with other solutions and will prevent content flashing since the layout will be server side rendered first.

```tailwind.config.ts
import type { Config } from 'tailwindcss';

const config: Config = {
  darkMode: 'class',
  content: [
    //...
	],
  //...
}
```

Now whenever we want to see dark mode CSS applied via Tailwind we only need to toggle `dark` class on the `html` element.

```tsx
<html className="dark"> // this can be either light or dark
// ...
<p className="text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-50">Hello World</p>
// ...
</html>
```

If the class on `html` element is set to 'dark' now the text will be white and black if not.

Handling the actual change and saving user preferences is slightly more involving.

## Creating ThemeContext and Provider

There are two main parts of the functionality we need to handle:

1. Storing the user preferences.
	1. Allow user to change the theme.
	1. Save the data on the client (browser).
2. Retrieving and sharing the preferred setting.
	1. Send current theme to the server.
	1. Share the current theme with across the components.

### How and Why - storing the user preferences

To keep user preferences regarding the theme we will use cookies as they are a key-value pair "database" but in the browser and they are sent to the server on every request. This fits our purpose perfectly as we need that value on initial render (for Server Side Rendering) and it stays with the user and is under his or hers control.

To prevent hydration errors we need to share the same state between server and client and both must be the same.

To store the theme for the client (browser) we will use [React's Context API](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) <NewTabIcon/>. In React we create Context when we want to share a property between components without prop-drilling (passing it down manually to all components).

### Designing the API for the component with TypeScript

I'll start slowly and explain crucial parts of the code, if you are familiar with the pattern you can scroll below to see the full source code.

To create new Context (and you can have many in your application) we use `createContext` function provided by React.

Let's think what we need our Context to be and what to provide:

1. we need to know what theme is currently selected and...
1. we need to be able to change the theme.

So our Context will need to keep both `theme` variable (that can be set to `light` or `dark`) and `setTheme` function to manipulate the `theme`. Knowing that let's name give it a name of `ThemeContext` and strongly type it:

```tsx
type ThemeContext = {
	theme: ColorThemeType;
	setTheme: React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<ColorThemeType>>;
};
```

To keep the `theme` variable in check we limit it's values to `light` and `dark` with the `ColorThemeType` type:

```ts
type ColorThemeType = 'light' | 'dark';
```

That way it will only be able to be set to predefined values when using TypeScript.

### Implementing the Context

Now that we have design of our function we can start coding it.

```tsx
const ThemeContext = createContext<ThemeContext | null>(null);

function Theme({ initialTheme = 'light', children }: ThemeProps) {
	//...
}
```

This will create new Context (think of it as an external slot or bucket for variables, outside of the components tree) and assign it a value of `null` (more on this in a second).

Context **MUST** be created **OUTSIDE** of the component itself.

I've decided to name it `Theme` but you will see components like this named `ThemeProvider`, 'ThemeContext' or similar more often to indicate they are utilizing the Context API.

Reference: [React `createContext` documentation](https://react.dev/reference/react/createContext) <NewTabIcon/>

```tsx
function Theme({ initialTheme = 'light', children }: ThemeProps) {
	const [theme, setTheme] = useState<ColorThemeType>(initialTheme);

	return (
		<ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, setTheme }}>
			{children}
		</ThemeContext.Provider>
	);
}
```

You can see that we are allowing to set the `initialTheme`, this is very important for SSR and just in case the value is not provided we are setting it to `light` by default. That way we are ensuring that the value is always available and stays consistent.

You will note that we are using `Provider` sub component that is a part of `ThemeContest`. The provider accepts a `value` prop that is the value/object/property that we want to share across the component's tree. It will be passed to **all** underlying components (children) of the `Theme` component. That value can be anything we want and usually it will be an object holding multiple properties or it could be a single property if we wanted theme to be read only.

Exxample of passing single read only value to context from React documentation:

```documentation-example.jsx
function App() {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');
  // ...
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}>
      <Page />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

Reference: [React documentation](https://react.dev/reference/react/createContext#provider) <NewTabIcon/>.

Finally we are rendering the `children` passed to the `Theme` - this will render all the components that we pass as the children of the `Theme`. This allows us to control from what level the `theme` and `setTheme` props are available.

### Creating custom hook to return the ThemeContext

One unusual thing about the way this Context Provider is written is the creation of `useThemeContext` hook.

Let's first look at how we would utilize `ThemeContext` without the custom hook.

Without the custom `useThemeContext` hook we would need to:

1. import the ThemeContext itself...
2. verify if the `theme` and `setTheme` values actually exist in the context...
3. throw an error if they don't.
4. Destructure them from the context variable and use them.

```tsx
import { ThemeContext } from '@/context/ThemeContext';

const context = useContext(ThemeContext);

if (!context) {
  throw new Error('ThemeContext must be used within ThemeContextProvider');
}

const { theme, setTheme } = context;
```

I think you can see the pattern here, and we would need to do this **every time**. And then there are those pesky TypeScript errors. As someone wise once said, that's no way to live your life.

This is why for every context we create we'll also provide a custom hook that will look like this:

```tsx
export function useThemeContext(): ThemeContext {
	const context = useContext(ThemeContext);

	if (context === undefined || context === null) {
		throw new Error('useThemeContext must be used within ThemeContextProvider');
	}

	return context;
}
```

By utilizing this pattern we encapsulate all the logic related to verifying that the hook can be safely used, we make our TypeScript checks happy and can simplify the way the consumers (developers) interact with the `ThemeContext`.
Now we only need to destructure `theme` and `setTheme` variables from the `useThemeContext` hook. If the hook is used outside of where the `ThemeContext` is defined it will throw an error notifying the developer that the function cannot be used at that level.

```usage-of-useThemeContext.tsx
  const { theme, setTheme } = useThemeContext();
```

Here's the full code for `ThemeContext` in TypeScript.
Note that Context use requires us to use the `'use client';` directive in Next.js.

```ThemeContext.tsx
'use client';
import React, { createContext, ReactNode, useContext, useState } from 'react';

import ColorThemeType from '@/types/ColorThemeType';

type ThemeContext = {
	theme: ColorThemeType;
	setTheme: React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<ColorThemeType>>;
};

type ThemeProps = {
	initialTheme: ColorThemeType;
	children: ReactNode;
};

const ThemeContext = createContext<ThemeContext | null>(null);

function Theme({ initialTheme = 'light', children }: ThemeProps) {
	const [theme, setTheme] = useState<ColorThemeType>(initialTheme);

	return (
		<ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, setTheme }}>
			{children}
		</ThemeContext.Provider>
	);
}

export function useThemeContext(): ThemeContext {
	const context = useContext(ThemeContext);

	if (context === undefined || context === null) {
		throw new Error('useThemeContext must be used within ThemeContextProvider');
	}

	return context;
}

export default Theme;
```

Our theme sharing logic is complete, we can use the `ThemeContext` to share what theme is currently selected with `theme` variable and we can change it via `setTheme` function shared by the `useThemeContext` hook.

But our users can't..

## Retrieving the theme settings and rendering theme on the server

With the business logic part done we can now start providing the functionality to the users on frontend of our application.

First we need to use the `Theme` component in a place from which we want to start allowing changes to the theme. Since theme is a part of every component it will usually be the root of the application and in Next.js 13 and later with App Router the best place to do this would be the main `layout.tsx` file located at `src/app/layout.tsx`.

Note that some code was omitted for the sake of brevity.

Note that this component **does not** use the `use client;` directive as it is a server side component and **must** be used on the server as it uses data from the cookie to retrieve the saved theme **before** it gets sent to the user.

```src/app/layout.tsx
import { cookies } from 'next/headers';

function RootLayout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {

	const savedThemeCookie = cookies().get('theme');
	const savedTheme: ColorThemeType = (savedThemeCookie?.value ??
		'light') as ColorThemeType;

	return (
			<Theme initialTheme={savedTheme}>
				<html
					lang="en"
					data-color-theme={savedTheme}
					className={cn(
						savedTheme,
					)}
				>
					<body
						className={cn(
							`
							text-theme-light-text-black
							bg-theme-light-background-primary

							dark:bg-theme-dark-background-primary
							dark:text-theme-dark-text-light
							`,
						)}
					>
							<div>
								<Header/>
								<main>{children}</main>
								<Footer/>
							</div>
					</body>
				</html>
			</Theme>
	);
}

export default RootLayout;
```

The part where we retrieve the `theme` variable from the cookies and set it while the page is still rendering on the server is the secret sauce to preventing content flashing as it will always be in sync with that the user sets on the clinet (soon) and by utilizing Tailwind we are sure that all the CSS we need for the page is already present.

```tsx
  const savedThemeCookie = cookies().get('theme');
	const savedTheme: ColorThemeType = (savedThemeCookie?.value ?? 'light') as ColorThemeType;

	return (
			<Theme initialTheme={savedTheme}>
      /* ^...^ */
      </Theme>
  );
```

We are also making sure that if the cookie is not set a default value is passed.

Then we pass that variable as `initialTheme`, since that value can change in the future, to the `Theme` context component.

We also set html class to the value of the `savedTheme`:

```tsx
<html
	lang="en"
	data-color-theme={savedTheme}
	className={savedTheme}
>
// ...
</html>
```

The `data-color-theme` helps to clearly see what theme is set in case your html tag is heavily customized.

This way we have completed the retrieving theme setting for the user.

### Toggling the theme and saving user preferences

For now we have achieved these goals:

- [x] We have a dark mode and light mode enabled via TailwindCSS.
- [x] We can retrieve the user preferences from the cookies stored in the browser.
- [x] We can share the theme between components in the application.

But we still cannot change the theme. Let's work on that next.

Cookie operations provided by next are available only on the server side, but we need to use it on the client side as well.

To manipulate cookies we'll use the `js-cookie` package.

install it with:

```bash
npm install js-cookie
```

Then we'll create a `ThemeToggle` component.

Thanks to our custom `useThemeContext` hook we can easily get current `theme` and `setTheme` functions.

Then:

1. Using a button we will render the moon or sun icons based on what value `theme` variable holds and
1. change it with `handleThemeChange` when it's clicked.
1. `handleThemeChange` function will in turn:
	1. Compute the next theme based on current `theme` value.
	1. Remove all possible values for the theme (remove everything to be safe).
	1. Replace the value of the theme to the opposite one.
	1. Store the new value or update existing one in a cookie.

Again some parts of the code (like imports and classes) had been removed to focus on the solution.

```ThemeToggle.tsx
const ThemeToggle: React.FC<ThemeToggleProps> = () => {
	const { theme, setTheme } = useThemeContext();

	const handleThemeChange = () => {
		// we are computing the next theme value so we do not end up using the stale value of the theme before it changes
		const nextTheme = theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light';

		setTheme(nextTheme);
		Cookie.set('theme', nextTheme, { expires: 380 });

		const root = document.documentElement;
		root.classList.remove('light');
		root.classList.remove('dark');
		root.classList.add(nextTheme);
	};

	return (
		<button onClick={handleThemeChange}>
			{theme === 'light' ? (
				<Sun/>
			) : (
				<Moon/>
			)}
			<VisuallyHidden>Toggle dark / light mode</VisuallyHidden>
		</button>
	);
};

export default ThemeToggle;
```

After displaying the `ThemeToggle` on a page and clicking the sun (or moon) icon the class assigned to the html tag changes!

With this we have achieved our final goal of allowing user to change the theme and save it.

## Defining styles for Dark Mode

Defining dark mode in TailwindCSS is straightforward: just add `dark:` prefix to the utility class name and it will only activate in dark mode. But now we can both use custom classes that we have full control of with tailwind and we have fully functional dark mode in our app.

```tsx
<p className="text-theme-light-text-black dark:text-theme-dark-text-light">Hello World</p>
```

How cool is that?! üòÅ

## Bonus - Using with NextUI

NextUI is a set of components that are beautifully crafted with nice touch of sensible animations styled with TailwindCSS ü§Ø. With the presented setup it will work out of the box after following the installation process as it uses Tailwind and class based detection for the dark mode. See the [installation guide for nextui components](https://nextui.org/docs/frameworks/nextjs) <NewTabIcon/> for more information.

## Conclusion

With the presented approach we have successfully created the design system with Tailwind and Next.js, configured and setup dark mode without content flashing and provided user with simple way to preserve the theme between site visits.
